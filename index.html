            >Hi, You just stepped into Prakriti's public terminal. I am
            currently being built up. Once ready, I will walk you through the
            life of Prakriti aka praks. You will be able to ask me about his
            areas of interests, hobbies, professional experiences and much more.
            Currently, I am built to support desktop version. I'll be soon
            available on mobile. Pardon me for any inconvenience and you can
            always reach out to the developer (prakritigupta1112002@gmail.com)
            for any queries/suggestions. As I continue to develop, you can
            always checkout my current features. Looking forward to an amazing
            interaction.
